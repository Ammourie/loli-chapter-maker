actually I create this ui using pyqt5 designer ,I want to change some things in future .
this program is used to create chapters for video files so that you can easily navigate from one point to anoher with "pageup"  and "pagedown" buttons on keyboard.

if you want to use this program ,you must install PyQt5 lib using pip command "pip install pyqt5"   and need to install media codecs from "https://codecguide.com/download_k-lite_codec_pack_full.htm" .
Hope you like it .
